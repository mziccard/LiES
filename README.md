#LiES
Solver of systems of linear equations with different techniques:

- backtracking
- backtracking wich variable selection according to the most constrained heuristic
- backtracking with constraint propagation (node and bound consistency)
- branch and bound

**LiES** includes a random problem generator exporting a randomly generated system of linear equations into a json formatted file.
